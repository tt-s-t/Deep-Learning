# AlexNet

## own folder
Self built AlexNet implementation.

***alexnet.py***
AlexNet's network structure.In order to adapt to the data set and maintain the original AlexNet network structure as much as possible, there are some changes behind the network (just random changes, just want to try AlexNet).

***model_run.py***
Use cifar dataset to call the self built AlexNet network for training test classification.

## alexnet_torch.py
Use cifar dataset to call the AlexNet network with built-in functions for training test classification.

## Note
In fact, the style of the dataset is not very suitable for this network, just for a demonstration.
