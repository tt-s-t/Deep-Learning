# VGG

## own folder
Self built VGG implementation.

***vgg.py***
VGG's network structure.In order to adapt to the data set and maintain the original VGG network structure as much as possible, there are some changes behind the network (just random changes, just want to try VGG).

***run.py***
Use cifar dataset to call the self built VGG network for training test classification.

## vgg_torch.py
Use cifar dataset to call the VGG network with built-in functions for training test classification.

## Note
In fact, the style of the dataset is not very suitable for this network, just for a demonstration.
